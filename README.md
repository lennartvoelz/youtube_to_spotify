# youtube_to_spotify
Since it always bugged me to manually create a playlist on Spotify with my favorite songs from YouTube, I decided to create this "WebApp"

To run on your local machine, you need the following dependencies:
-flask
-spotipy
-googleapiclient
-pandas
-time

Make sure to edit app.py: replace the placeholders with your API keys to YouTube and Spotify
Then you can parse a YouTube URL to a playlist containing your songs.
